# Hi there

My name is Leo, but I go by *LeoDT* or *LeoDoesThings* online.  
  
I make stuff. 
  
In my spare time I like to code and in 2018 I decided to make some of my stuff open-source on GitHub. 
  
Some of my biggest projects are:

- [**ShpeeBot**](https://github.com/LeoDoesThings/ShpeeBot) which is a pretty cool multipurpose Discord bot!
- A yet to be released game! ðŸ˜²

So, that's it.  
I know. I'm pretty boring.
