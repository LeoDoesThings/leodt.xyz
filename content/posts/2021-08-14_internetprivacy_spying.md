When was the last time you read the terms and conditions before clicking 'agree'? You're not alone, ***78% of American adults do not fully read or do not read terms and conditions at all before agreeing to them.***[^1] But you use the internet every single day; you send emails, post on social media, search on Google and more, without knowing the details of your legal contracts with the internet companies that provide you with those services. Heck, unless you're a lawyer, you don't even know your 'terms and conditions with your own government! Everything you do online adds to your digital footprint, and both companies and your government will use it whether you like it or not. You permitted them when you agreed to those terms and conditions, remember?

Internet companies track you. Not a big surprise if you have a basic understanding of today's internet.
> **"Surveillance is the business model of the internet. We're the product, not the customer."**  
  — Bruce Schneier, cybersecurity expert.[^2]

Almost all internet companies make their money through advertising. Corporations like Google and Facebook have robot Sherlock Holmes to find out everything about you: what your interests are, your habits, your preferences. They can even determine your risk tolerance and sexual orientation! And they'll use that to show you ads that they know you'll click. The internet isn't free. We pay for it with our own identity. ***81% of US adults believe they have little to no control over the data companies collect from them and that the potential risks outweigh the benefits.***[^3] Imagine internet companies as virtual vacuum cleaners, sucking up our information breadcrumb trail we leave online. They store all this information in 'the cloud': an infinitely large invisible internet realm. Pretty cool, right? Especially if you're a hacker because nothing is impenetrable. The cloud is the hackers' gold mine. Identities, addresses, bank details, phone numbers and more, just waiting to be pilfered. Internet companies shouldn't have this information in the first place - they don't need it! But they're going to keep collecting it until governments stop sitting on their asses and do something about it.

Your government is spying on you. More specifically, they can spy on you.
> **"We kill people based on metadata"**  
  — Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA.[^4]

The US government's NSA mass surveillance program was and still is collecting information. And don't think for a second that you're safe because you're not in the US - the internet is international. They could peek through your phone's camera right now if they felt like it. Why? There is no ‘why’, they're doing this without warrants. ***The New Zealand 1993 Privacy Act was updated in 2020, enforcing more requirements on internet companies providing their services in New Zealand, with criminal offence fines of up to $10,000.***[^5] It took an entire 27 years for New Zealand to update their privacy laws. It's also not doing enough. $10,000 is pocket change for a tech company. There is no incentive for them to try to do better. The internet is a lightning-fast, constantly progressing digital creature, and politics needs to keep up.

Internet laws aren't doing enough. The internet has evolved, and now the laws must evolve too. ***Roughly 6 in 10 US adults believe it is not possible to go through daily life without companies collecting data from them.***[^6] Being a person in the 21st century means you use the internet. There's no escaping it. Why look for information in a book when you have a computer in your pocket? The internet has become a crucial, easily accessible resource for almost anything. Internet companies are taking advantage of outdated laws and exploiting us legally. The amount of data they're collecting is so immense that they're making A.I.s trained off the backs of real people - us. The more we take from the internet, the less we have. ***Total internet use increased by around 70% during 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.***[^7] During the pandemic, we relied on technology to stay connected. The internet welcomed us with open arms, and we gladly accepted their offer of anything and everything you would ever want to do - for free. COVID-19 exposed how ill-equipped world governments are for unexpected issues, but data collection isn't an unforeseen issue - it's being ignored. I know I used the internet a lot more during the lockdown. You probably did as well. But you need to know that there was something, or even someone, on the other side of the screen watching you.

What do you think about the internet now? Now you know that there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than you initially thought. Governments could have spies spying on you. Companies could have androids analysing you. And they're doing it with your consent - it was all in the terms and conditions.

**Author's Note**

This was originally written for a school assessment, but I ended up posting this here since the main point of this writing was to spread awareness.  
There's a reference to New Zealand laws because I'm a student in NZ.  
Statistics and quotes were not cross-referenced since they didn't count towards my final grade (I didn't even have to include sources! I literally could have made up a quote or statistic and my mark wouldn't be affected). I've tried my best to reference quotes and statistics to the websites I used to find them.  
  
Thanks for reading!
