**Alpha 1 Release**  
  
tl:dr - Alpha 1 is out, you can [download it here](https://github.com/ShpeeBot/ShpeeBot/releases/tag/v9.0.0-alpha1) and it should be used for testing purposes only.

### The First Alpha Release
It is so good to finally put this out there.
  
**Please keep in mind that this is released under alpha status for a reason. Don't go around using this version of the bot just yet.**  

A lot of things are broken after upgrading to Discord.js v12 and I haven't been able to get around to fixing them.

The entire purpose of this release is so if you're interested in using ShpeeBot 9 when I can finally finish it, you can contribute to the development process by finding issues/bugs and reporting them to me so I can fix them early on in development instead of later on causing huge problems for eveyone involved.

If you're super duper interested in the development process, I'll be updating [this doc](https://doc.clickup.com/p/h/6kdt2-9/10fbe3e33b93f51) every time I make a change to the ShpeeBot code so you'll be in the know on all changes before release.

  
Thanks for being a part of the community that lets me enjoy programming.
