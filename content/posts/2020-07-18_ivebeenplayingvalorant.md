**WHERE IS SHPEE VERSION 9???**  
  
Well you see, I've been playing Valorant. *(and Hypixel Skyblock but that's not important)*

### Shpee v9 So Far

So far, so good.  
  
The dashboard has been getting along fine. This post includes a screenshot of what the new dashboard looks like right now **but keep in mind that things might change.**  
  
I'll start work on revamping the music commands after I'm done with the dashboard.  
  
Also Shpee works completely fine on Node 10 without any changes needed. But things break from Node 11 onwards so I'll be working on that too.  
  
So thats it. I have school starting again next week so development is gonna slow down even more but version 9 is coming!
