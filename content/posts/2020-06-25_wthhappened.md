### GitHub design overhaul???

Ok so apparently GitHub has been getting a lot of design changes over the past month.  
  
I didn't notice while it was happening because I took a break from GitHub since I had a bunch of assessments and exams sneak up on me and whack me in the head.  

### ShpeeBot updates

Anyway, it's the holidays for me in a week so I'll be able to go back to properly updating ShpeeBot then.  
I haven't updated ShpeeBot in a few months now because I just want to get v9 released.  
  
Version 9 will include a complete dashboard redesign and new code formatting since v8 is just a mess of me trying to figure out how the hell Discord.js works.  
I'm also trying to upgrade ShpeeBot-v9 to use Node v9 as well since Discord.js is already updated to use Node v12!  
  
  
Okay, sorry for wasting 2 minutes of your life and expect a ShpeeBot update sometime soon after I figure out how the hell to use the new GitHub.
